<p>During COVID-19 quarantining, I realized what I missed most in life: loud music, bouldering, and community spaces. After receiving a Kellogg MBA, I returned to Greenpoint to open my dream business venture. </p>
<p><strong>Our Mission</strong> is to be an inclusive, safe venue for bouldering enthusiasts and music lovers. From metal yoga, to outdoors hiking trips, we promise you'll find activities and a community of people you'll love here. </p>
