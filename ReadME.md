When I lived in Greenpoint for 6 years, the two places I enjoyed going to the most was GP-81 bouldering gym and Saint Vitus metal bar. Greenpoint, a small community with beautiful views of Manhattan, was a place where you could deep dive into something new with ease (as opposed to Manhattan, where trying something new meant dealing with long lines and snobby people). 

For this project, I created a fake webpage dream business combining three of my loves: metal, rock climbing, and sausages. Bouldering gyms are typically cavernous, wide locations full of esoteric individuals - in other words, a great spot for a metal bar at night! 

My project is composed of three pages: a homepage, a menu/directions, and an about me. I hope you enjoy!
